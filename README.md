## Category Theory

A structured and intuitive exploration of category theory —  
functors, natural transformations, Yoneda lemma, limits, colimits, and more.

This repository contains:
- Clear explanations
- Intuitive stories
- Visual diagrams
- Connections to abstract algebra and linear algebra

## Foundations

1. **Objects and Morphisms**
   - Basic units of structure
    
2. **Hard vs Soft Categories**
   - Hard: index-like, atomic, non-collapsible
   - Soft: relational, collapsible by external observation

3. **Shape**
   - Pure arrow-patterns
   - Graphs + composition
   - Pattern as the essence of structure

4. **Functors**
   - Structure-preserving maps  
   - What does it mean for a functor to preserve structure?  
   - Representation via free generation

## Limits

1. **Cones and Constant Functors**
   - The index category as a standard to be reproduced
   - Maximum image: the index category drawn inside a category without any identifications
   - Minimum image: the index category collapsed to a single point via a constant functor

2. **Universal Property**
   - The “best” or most universal cone
   - Uniqueness up to a unique morphism

3. **Examples of Limits**
   - **Terminal objects**: limits of empty diagrams
   - **Initial objects**: colimits of empty diagrams
   - **Products**: binary products as limits, with projections as legs of a universal cone
   - **Equalizers**: limits of parallel pairs, enforcing equality via a universal condition





## 🧩 Philosophy & Structure

Category theory is the language of structures.  
It reveals patterns behind algebra, topology, logic, and computation.

This repository is part of the **Structure Lab** project.

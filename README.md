## Category Theory

A structured and intuitive exploration of category theory —  
functors, natural transformations, Yoneda lemma, limits, colimits, and more.

This repository contains:
- Clear explanations
- Intuitive stories
- Visual diagrams
- Connections to abstract algebra and linear algebra

## Foundations

1. **Objects and Morphisms**
   - Basic units of structure
    
2. **Hard vs Soft Categories**
   - Hard: index-like, atomic, non-collapsible
   - Soft: relational, collapsible by external observation

3. **Shape**
   - The shape itself is the whole meaning: nothing hides behind it
   - Pure mapping

4. **Functors and Natural Transformations**
   - Structure-preserving maps  
   - What does it mean for a functor to preserve structure?  
   - Representation via free generation  
   - Natural transformations as comparisons between functors with the same source and target  
   - Dependence on the target category: what counts as “structure” is determined by where you map into

## Limits

1. **Cones and Constant Functors**
   - The index category as a standard to be reproduced
   - Maximum image: the index category drawn inside a category without any identifications
   - Minimum image: the index category collapsed to a single point via a constant functor

2. **Universal Property**
   - The “best” or most universal cone
   - Uniqueness up to a unique morphism

3. **Examples of Limits**
   - **Terminal objects**: limits of empty diagrams
   - **Initial objects**: colimits of empty diagrams
   - **Products**: binary products as limits, with projections as legs of a universal cone
   - **Equalizers**: limits of parallel pairs, enforcing equality via a universal condition

## Free Generation and Adjunctions

1. **Free Generation**
   - Uniqueness
   - Number category (in Lawvere’s sense)

2. **NNO (Natural Numbers Object)**
   - Infinity
   - Expressing structure as form

3. **Free Groups and Z3**

4. **Adjoint Functors**

## Yoneda Lemma

1. **You Inside Me (너 안에 나)**
   - The number of ways you fit into me is the number of times you appear inside me
   - Concretely: how many suitable maps from one object into another live inside a Hom-set

2. **Yoneda Embedding**
   - How are objects defined?
   - Objects as determined by the ways other objects map to them (or from them)

3. **Yoneda Lemma**
   - General mapping principle
   - The unit of the Yoneda embedding
   - Forms by layer: how Yoneda looks at different levels (elements, functors, natural transformations, universality)

## 🧩 Philosophy & Structure

Category theory is the language of structures.  
It reveals patterns behind algebra, topology, logic, and computation.

This repository is part of the **Structure Lab** project.
